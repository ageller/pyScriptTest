# pyScript Test
testing [pyScript](https://pyscript.net/) 

Oh boy...  My conclusions from this test is that (a) pyScript is rapidly evolving and (b) the documentation is not keeping up! 

Also note that Bokeh callbacks still need to be written in Javascript.... so what is the benefit of using pyScript with Bokeh?

A live version of this demo is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/pyScriptTest/app/).
